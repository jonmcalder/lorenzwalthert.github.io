Recently, I have been involved in a few projects related to 
R software development: 

- *styler. Non-invasive pretty printing of R code*. Through 
  [Google Summer of Code 2017](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com), I worked 
  with my mentors [Kirill Mueller](https://twitter.com/krlmlr) and 
  [Yihui Xie](https://twitter.com/xieyihui) on a 
  [source code formatter](https://github.com/r-lib/styler) for R. You can 
  install it from CRAN. Check out [this](/stylerpost/) blog post about it.

- *strcode. Structure and abstract your code.* A package that mainly provides 
  RStudio Add-ins to insert code breaks as well as tools to analyse code. Check
  out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/strcode) here.

- *gitsum. Parse and summarize git repository history*. This
  [package](https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/gitsum) allows
  you to extract file-level information for all commits in a git repo and can
  create summary reports based on that information. 
  
- *refactor. Better factor handling with R.* This is an 
  R package that aims to make working with categorical variables
  more fun. Have a look at the 
  [GitHub Page](https://jonmcalder.github.io/refactor/) of the project or at the
  [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jonmcalder/refactor).

You can find more projects on my personal 
[GitHub](https://github.com/lorenzwalthert) account.
