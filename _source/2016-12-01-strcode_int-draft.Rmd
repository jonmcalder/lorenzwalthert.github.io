## Introduction
I am pleased to announce my package strcode (short for structuring code), a 
package that should make structuring code easer. You can install it from
github, a CRAN release is planned at a later stage.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("lorenzwalthert/strcode")
```
A real-world example where strcode was used can be found in my last blog post
on programming with ggplot2.
